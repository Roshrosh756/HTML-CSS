# HTML-CSS
## First Mini Project
Here I learned the basics of HTML/CSS. 
I made a facebook sign up page using html and css only. 
## I practiced using forms and input and used basic semantic tags, and learned about the attributes, and basic html.
## I learned how to style web pages using CSS. 
I explored through margin, padding, background-color, text-align, justify-content, font-family, font-size, width, and border and learned about how these elements control the appearance of HTML.

This project helped me to strengthen my skills. You can view the project by downloading the file in your browser.
